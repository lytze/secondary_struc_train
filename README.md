This work was the course project of "Computational Biology" tought at Zhejiang University. The original dataset was referring to the UCI ML Repository ["Molecular Biology (Protein Secondary Structure) Data Set"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+(Protein+Secondary+Structure)). The request was to write (without calling 3rd party packages) an application with which users can train a simple artificial neural network to predict secondary structure of given peptides.

Here I wrote an R-shiny web application to fullfill the user interface and use R language to implement the predicting ANN. The web app is hosted on my [VPS here](http://121.40.203.126/lytze_apps/secondary_struc_train/). Users can upload training data, adjust the parameters and submit a job. Using the job ID generated by the host, users can check the progress after re-open the web page. When the training process is finished, users can use the same ID to visit the trained model, using the model to predict secondary structures of new sequences uploaded.

(My VPS is not very powerfull, the progress might be slow)
